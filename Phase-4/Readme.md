# üìä SQL Project Phase 4 ‚Äì Advanced SQL Operations

## üîç Overview

This phase of the SQL project demonstrates advanced database operations across **25 tables**, with **\~20 queries per table**, covering:

* **Views**
* **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
* **Stored Procedures**
* **Data Control Language (DCL)**
* **Transaction Control Language (TCL)**
* **Triggers**

Each table includes a structured set of SQL queries categorized by functionality to simulate real-world database tasks and logic handling.

## üß© Topics Covered

### 1. **Views**

Reusable query definitions to present data in various formats:

* Customer order history
* Product inventory insights
* Supplier performance dashboards

### 2. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**

Modular, readable query components used for:

* Aggregations
* Filtering logic
* Temporary calculations

### 3. **Stored Procedures**

Automated reusable logic for:

* CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
* Complex data processing

### 4. **DCL (Data Control Language)**

*(Optional in this phase, depending on file content)*

* Manages user access permissions

### 5. **TCL (Transaction Control Language)**

Ensures data integrity through:

* Transactions (`START TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`)

### 6. **Triggers**

Event-based automation for:

* Logging actions
* Validating inputs
* Enforcing business rules

## üß† Learning Objectives

By completing this phase, you‚Äôll gain hands-on experience with:

* Writing maintainable and secure SQL code
* Implementing automation using triggers
* Safeguarding data operations using transactions
* Creating scalable and modular SQL procedures

---

## üìÅ File Structure

* **`Phase 4.sql`**: Contains all SQL scripts for views, CTEs, stored procedures, triggers, and transactions.
* Organized into blocks per table (e.g., `Products`, `Customers`, `Orders`, etc.)
* Each query is clearly labeled with:

  * Query number
  * Type
  * Description

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. Import your full database schema and sample data (Tables 1‚Äì25) into MySQL.
2. Run `Phase 4.sql` sequentially or execute queries table-wise.
3. Review the outputs and logs generated by triggers and stored procedures.
4. Modify and expand for your own use cases or academic submissions.

## üìö Example Tables Included

* `Products`
* `Customers`
* `Categories`
* `Orders`
* `Order_Items`
* `Suppliers`
* `Payments`
* `Payment_Methods`
* `Addresses`
* *(And more... up to 25 total)*

## ‚úÖ Status

> ‚úÖ Completed and tested on MySQL
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure `DELIMITER` commands are properly handled when running triggers/stored procedures.
