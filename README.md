# 🛒 Amazon Database Project (SQL)

A full-stack SQL-based project simulating Amazon's e-commerce database system. This project was built across **4 Phases** and showcases real-world use of database design, data manipulation, and advanced querying techniques.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates an Amazon-like environment using **MySQL**. It includes customer management, product catalog, order processing, and shipment tracking using multiple interconnected tables and advanced SQL features.

---

## 📁 Phase Breakdown

### 🔹 Phase 1: Database Design
- Created core tables for the Amazon system:
  - `Customers`, `Products`, `Orders`, `Order_Items`, `Payments`
  - `Sellers`, `Shipments`, `Reviews`, `Categories`, `Inventory`
- Used **`CREATE TABLE`** with primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.
- Populated sample data using **`INSERT INTO`**.

---

### 🔹 Phase 2: DDL, DML, Clauses & Operators
- DDL Commands: `ALTER`, `DROP`, `RENAME`, etc.
- DML Commands: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- Used various **SQL Clauses**:
  - `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `HAVING`, `LIMIT`
- Operators used:
  - Logical (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`), Comparison (`=`, `>`, `<`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`)

---

### 🔹 Phase 3: Joins, Subqueries & Functions
- **Joins**: Inner, Left, Right, Full, and Self Joins to link customer, product, and order data
- **Subqueries**: Scalar and correlated subqueries to extract filtered or nested info
- **Built-in Functions**: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `NOW()`, `LENGTH()`, etc.
- **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**: Custom logic for calculations like discount logic or cart value

---

### 🔹 Phase 4: Views, CTEs, Procedures, Triggers & More
- **Views**: Reusable query views like `order_summary`, `customer_reviews`
- **CTEs**: Used `WITH` for temporary result sets in multi-step logic
- **Stored Procedures**: Automated tasks like generating monthly reports
- **DCL**: `GRANT`, `REVOKE` for access management
- **TCL**: `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT` for transaction control
- **Triggers**: Example: update inventory count when an order is placed
- **Window Functions**: `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `OVER()` used for analytics

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Mastered real-life database schema design
- Practiced all levels of SQL: from basic queries to advanced logic
- Gained hands-on experience with procedures, triggers, and window functions
- Improved understanding of data relationships in e-commerce platforms

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Database**: MySQL 8.x
- **Query Tool**: MySQL Workbench
- **Language**: SQL
